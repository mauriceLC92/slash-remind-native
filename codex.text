› I use the make build and make run command. So the source of truth for code is whatever works builds and run in that code. Does that make
    sense. so whatever code is used for that to build and run is what I want to keep plus anything else needed so I cant just continue working on theis projecct. Can you
  derive a plan for that


◦

• That makes sense. If make build/make run defines truth, then the canonical code is currently the Xcode project referenced by Makefile.
  Plan is to make that project local to this repo so one folder is enough.

  Plan

  1. Define canonical target

  - Canonical project: the one Makefile builds and runs (SlashRemind scheme).
  - Goal state: same behavior, but fully inside this repo (no ../SlashRemindApp/... dependency).

  2. Import real Xcode project into this repo

  - Copy in the real SlashRemind.xcodeproj and required app metadata folder (SlashRemind/Info.plist, entitlements).
  - Remove/replace the current in-repo SlashRemindApp/ stub.

  3. Repoint project file paths to in-repo source

  - Ensure target source references point to this repo’s folders: App/, Services/, Palette/, ViewModels/, Preferences/, StatusBar/, Utilities/, Resources/, Tests/.
  - Resolve known drift files (RemindersAPI.swift, HotKeyService.swift, SettingsStore.swift, PaletteViewModel.swift, etc.) with one final merged version.

  4. Update Makefile to local paths

  - Change XCODE_PROJECT from ../SlashRemindApp/... to the in-repo .xcodeproj path.
  - Keep SCHEME := SlashRemind.

  5. Validate end-to-end

  - Run: make clean, make build, make test, make run.
  - Confirm app behavior uses edits from this repo immediately (no manual sync).

  6. Clean up dual-repo debt

  - Remove docs that describe dual-repo workflow.
  - Archive/delete external sibling repo only after successful local validation.

  7. Add guardrails

  - Add CI check or local check: fail if rg "../SlashRemindApp" finds references.
  - Update contributor docs to state single-repo workflow only.

  Done criteria

  - make build and make run work from this repo.
  - No path reference to external sibling repo.
  - Editing files in this repo is enough to build/run/test the app.

  If you want, I can execute this migration now in small, reversible commits.



  › Read REPOSITORY-STRUCTURE.md and based on this codebase what is the way forward such that I can jiust keep the one correct project folder in this repo
